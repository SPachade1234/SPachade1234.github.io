        <h2>Beginning of the Dynasty (Late 1990s - 2001)</h2>
            <p>The Patriots have had 2 former head coaches, Bill Parcells from 1993 to 1996 and Pete Carroll from 1997 to 1999, who led the team to multiple playoff appearances. Parcells led the team to Super Bowl XXXI. Despite the somewhat success, Parcells left due to disagreements with the team and a few years later Carroll was fired. In 2000, the team hired their present coach Bill Belichick who will eventually lead the team to 8 Super Bowl appearances in the 21st century and win 5 rings. The Patriots would draft Tom Brady, a 6th rounder at 199th, who will eventually be considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time and a key part in each of the team's 5 Super Bowl wins.</p>
        <h2>The Dynasty Is Born (2001 - 2005)</h2>
            <p>The Patriots new starting QB, Tom Brady leads the team to the Super Bowl in the culminaton of the 2001 season. Despite this sucess, the Patriots looked bad in the 2002 season and week 1 of 2003 season. Afterwards, the Patriots go 34 - 3 win-loss record over the next 2 seasons; this includes playoff games, 2 Super Bowl wins, and a 21-game long streak. Thus the dynasty is born and continues to play and get better every season.</p>

        <h2>Continued Success (2006 - Present)</h2>
            <p>The New England Patriots will enter the playoffs every single season except 2008 (Tom Brady gets injured and out for the season). After the 3 Super Bowl appearances (2001, 2003, 2004), the Patriots will have 5 more appearances (2007, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017) and win 3 of the 5 appearances; this ties them with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, who each have 5 Super Bowl appearances. Since 2009, the Patriots have made the playoffs every single season, always ending at the top of their divison in every season since. Since 2010, the Patriots have started off the playoffs in the Divisonal Round. Since 2011, they have been on a 7-game streak of appearances in the AFC Conference Championship. The New England Patriots have also won the most championsship games in the entire league, irrespective of conference.</p>
